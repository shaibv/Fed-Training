    -   Header, navigation and footer are always visible (sticky)
    -   Content panel (right) should be scrollable depending on the amount of text there.
    -   Page should be responsive but height of header and footer does not change, only the middle part changes.
3.  Implement the same layout with flexbox.

4.  Replicate the first section of the Premium Package Picker.
    To get to this page, go to your site dashboard -> click on `compare plans` (or one of the other million ways to upgrade your site).
